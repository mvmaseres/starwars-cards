                <p class="text-about">
                    Our primary data source for the game is the Star Wars API, affectionately known as "swapi." This API is the first quantified and programmatically accessible data source for all information in the canonical Star Wars universe. By leveraging this API, we can offer players a diverse range of options for guessing and exploring in our card game. For more details on how to interact with the API and the data available, visit swapi.dev.

                    Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges, including prioritization, structural design due to limited experience, and tackling design complexities. Each challenge presented an opportunity for growth and learning, allowing me to refine my skills and enhance the overall project.

                <p class="text-about">
                    Looking to the future, I aspire to enhance the overall design and introduce animations. Ideas include incorporating an animated plane that takes off to carry the suggestions form. Continuous user feedback is vital for implementing these improvements, ensuring the game evolves based on the needs and preferences of its players.

                    Finally, I would like to thank CIFO Hospitalet for giving me the opportunity to start this project. Special thanks to Albert Mata, our teacher, and my classmates for their support and shared experiences. Thanks to them I have been able to create an attractive and fun Star Wars card game that I hope will bring joy to all who explore the galaxy inside their virtual cards.
