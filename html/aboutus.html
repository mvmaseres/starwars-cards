                        Our primary data source for the game is the Star Wars API, affectionately known as "swapi." This API is the first quantified and programmatically accessible data source for all information in the canonical Star Wars universe. By leveraging this API, we can offer players a diverse range of options for guessing and exploring in our card game. For more details on how to interact with the API and the data available, visit swapi.dev.

                    My journey has been marked by significant challenges, notably in mastering APIs and leveraging localStorage effectively. Developing a functional login system in the absence of a backend infrastructure presented its own unique set of obstacles. However, each challenge has served as an opportunity for growth and learning.

                    Our next steps involve enhancing the responsiveness of our website. Within the collections section, we aim to create a clearer distinction between earned and locked cards. Additionally, we're working on enabling the sharing of earned cards. Stay tuned as we continue to refine and enhance your gaming experience.

                    Finally, I would like to thank CIFO Hospitalet for giving me the opportunity to start this project. Special thanks to Albert Mata, our teacher, and my classmates for their support and shared experiences. Thanks to them I have been able to create an attractive and fun Star Wars card game that I hope will bring joy to all who explore the galaxy inside their virtual cards.
